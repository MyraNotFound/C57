            decade, he played the eponymous role in seven sequels, culminating with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
            â€“ Part 2 (2011). During this period, he became one of the world's highest-paid actors and gained worldwide
            fame, popularity, and critical acclaim.

            Following the success of Harry Potter, Radcliffe played lawyer Arthur Kipps in the horror film The Woman in
            Black (2012), poet Allen Ginsberg in the drama film Kill Your Darlings (2013), Igor in the science-fiction
            horror film Victor Frankenstein (2015), a sentient corpse in the comedy-drama film Swiss Army Man (2016),
            technological prodigy Walter Mabry in the heist thriller film Now You See Me 2 (2016), and FBI agent Nate
            Foster in the critically acclaimed thriller film Imperium (2016). Since 2019, he has starred in the TBS
            anthology series Miracle Workers.

            Radcliffe branched out to stage acting in 2007, starring in the West End and Broadway productions of Equus
            and in the 2011 Broadway revival of the musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. He
            continued in Martin McDonagh's dark comedy The Cripple of Inishmaan (2011) in the West End and Broadway and
            a revival of Tom Stoppard's play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (2017) at The Old Vic. He also
            starred in the satirical plays Privacy (2016) and The Lifespan of a Fact (2018), respectively off-Broadway
            and Broadway.
